# weatherdashboard
The weatherdashboard website allows users to search for any city and be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When viewing current weather conditions for that city the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When the user wants to view future weather condition the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
